**Abstract** <br>
Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central
problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of
optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on
minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking
high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this
paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable
of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an
adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is
trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by
perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily
downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN.
The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method.

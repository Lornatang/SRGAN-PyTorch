### About Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network

If you're new to SRGAN, here's an abstract straight from the paper:

Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional
neural networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we
super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally
driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared
reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking
high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at
the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image
super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images
for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss
and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network
that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we
use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is
able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive
mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained
with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art
method.

### Model Description

We have two networks, G (Generator) and D (Discriminator).The Generator is a network for generating images. It receives
a random noise z and generates images from this noise, which is called G(z).Discriminator is a discriminant network that
discriminates whether an image is real. The input is x, x is a picture, and the output is D of x is the probability that
x is a real picture, and if it's 1, it's 100% real, and if it's 0, it's not real.

If you want to load weights that you've trained before, run the following command.

```bash
$ python3 train.py -a srgan --start-psnr-epoch 10 --resume-psnr weights/PSNR_epoch10.pth [image-folder with train and val folders] 
```
